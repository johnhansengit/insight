#### **_DESCRIPTION_**

**Insight** offers users a place to track, analyze, and take control of their emotional lives.

**THE NEED**

Many of us find it challenging to articulate, understand, and manage the myriad emotions we experience daily. We also take for granted how much basics like sunlight, sleep, exercise, and food influence our emotions, and how powerful these habits can be for hacking our mental health. Insight addresses this by providing a user-friendly platform for understanding and taking charge of your emotional landscape.

**UNIQUE FEATURES**
- **Emotion Picker:** Browse and select the emotions you experience each day from a large and layered list, ranging from the general the specific. Based on popular emotion wheels, the emotion picker is great tool for improving your ability to identify and articulate more precisely the feelings you have. Zoom out to a colorful timeline view, and start to see patterns emerge.

- **Daily Lifestyle Tracker:** Toggle and rate things like sleep quality, stress, whether you ate heathily, whether you connected socially, etc. Over time, use our in-built AI to analyze these against the emotions you experienced, in order to identify trends and associations. Watch your mental health change as your lifestyle fluctuates. You pick which lifestyle factors you want to track.

- **Journaling:** Express yourself through journaling and gain deeper insights into your emotional journey. Our integrated AI can analyze your entries to provide personalized, data-driven insights into what influences your emotional life and how to manage it effectively.
