#### **_DESCRIPTION_**

**Insight** offers users a place to track, analyze, and take control of their emotional lives.

**THE NEED**

Many of us find it challenging to articulate, understand, and manage the myriad emotions we experience daily. We also take for granted how much basics like sunlight, sleep, exercise, and food influence our emotions, and how powerful these habits can be for hacking our mental health. Insight addresses this by providing a user-friendly platform for understanding and taking charge of your emotional landscape.

**UNIQUE FEATURES**
- **Emotion Wheel:** Browse and select the emotions you experience each day from a large and layered list, ranging from the general the specific. Based on tools commonly used by therapists and couselors, the Emotion Wheel is great for improving your ability to identify and articulate more precisely the feelings you have. 

- **Daily Lifestyle Log:** Toggle and rate things like sleep quality, stress, whether you ate heathily, whether you connected socially, etc. You pick which lifestyle factors you want to track in your unique User Settings.

- **Journaling:** Express yourself through journaling and gain deeper insights into your emotional journey. 

- **Timeline View:** Zoom out to a colorful Timeline view, and start to see patterns emerge. Analyze your emotional patterns against a variety of lifestyle factors, and start to see trends in how your sleep, diet, and other habits impact your emotional life. Over time, use our in-built AI to analyze your emotion data, lifestyle data, and journal entries on a larger and deeper scale, providing personalized, data-driven insights into what influences your emotional life and how to manage it effectively.
  
**WHO IS INSIGHT FOR?**
Insight is tailored for individuals who struggle to identify or articulate their emotions, as well as those seeking help to understand emotional triggers and manage their mental wellbeing effectively. Whether you're navigating daily stressors or simply want to lead a more emotionally balanced life, Insight is your trusted companion.

#### **_PLANNED FUTURE UPDATES_**

In the future, we hope to integrate even more functionality and refinement:

- Badges to reward app use (e.g. logging three days in a row) as well as lifestyle improvements (e.g. exercising 3+ times in a week)
- Upgrade to 'higher level' emotion wheels with greater specificity
- Add emotions that aren't in the wheel
- Generate 'snapshots' of your week/month to share with your therapist/counsellor
- Activate different lifestyle 'modules' that feature more detailed, in-depth tracking (e.g. quality of sleep, number of hours)
- Feature walkthrough upon sign-up
- Toggling light and dark mode
- DRYer, cleaner code!
